# 📈 Marketing ROI Automator

### Project Overview
This Python-based tool automates the calculation of **Net Profit** and **ROI Percentage** for digital marketing campaigns. By moving beyond simple "vanity metrics," this script provides a data-driven view of campaign performance linked directly to financial outcomes.

### Business Metrics Calculated:
- **Net Profit:** (Revenue - Ad Spend - COGS)
- **ROI %:** (Net Profit / Total Investment)

### Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** Pandas (for data manipulation)

### Why this matters for the 2026 Market
In 2026, recruiters in high-paying markets like **Germany** and the **Netherlands** look for marketers who can bridge the gap between "Clicks" and the **Balance Sheet**. This tool proves I can automate that process using code.
