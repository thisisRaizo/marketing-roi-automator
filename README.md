# 📈 Marketing ROI Automator

### Project Overview
This Python-based tool automates the calculation of **Net Profit** and **ROI Percentage** for digital marketing campaigns. By moving beyond simple "vanity metrics" like clicks or impressions, this script provides a data-driven view of campaign performance linked directly to financial outcomes.

### 🎯 Business Logic Applied
Unlike standard marketing reports, this tool incorporates **Accounting Principles** to find the "Cold, Hard ROI":
- **Net Profit:** Calculated as `Revenue - Ad Spend - COGS` (Cost of Goods Sold).
- **ROI %:** Calculated as `(Net Profit / Total Investment) * 100`.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas (for structured data manipulation).
- **Functionality:** Automates the processing of multi-campaign datasets to identify high-performing segments instantly.

### 🌍 Why this matters for the 2026 EU Market
In high-paying markets like **Germany** and **the Netherlands**, recruiters look for "Hybrid Marketers" who can bridge the gap between creative strategy and the **Balance Sheet**. This project demonstrates my ability to use **Python (Pandas)** to drive financial transparency in marketing.
